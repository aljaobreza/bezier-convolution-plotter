Cubic Bezier curve convolution drawer and editor, made for a school project.

Functionalities:
-
 - Drawing Mode: toggle to draw control points on a mouse click,
 - Add Convolution: starts drawing a new convolution when drawing mode is toggled,
 - Delete Convolution: removes the selected convolution,
 - Ensure Continuity: ensures continuity C⁰ of the selected convolution,
 - Ensure Smoothness: ensures continuity C¹ of the selected convolution.

When drawing mode isn't enabled, convolutions can be selected by clicking near them. Curves of the selected convolution can be edited by clicking and dragging the control points.
